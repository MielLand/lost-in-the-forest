Hello, i have recently learned python 2 weeks ago. This was my very first big project with 250 lines of code. I know this is not top-tier coding, but hopefully i can get some opinions and tips.

Please comment on this post and tell me what you think i should improve, if you want to contact me through discord. My discord is Miel#3694
You can run the application by going into dist >> adventure >> adventure.exe (it's called adventure, file type is Application)
Thank you!
